# <vacation-trip-planner-api>

  The vacation trip planner allows the visitor to create a trip itinerary based on available lodging around the world. There are authentication features that allow the traveler to see the available lodging and add the residence to the trip plan. I would love to travel the world someday and this application is just the catalyst for making that dream come true. 

Users can sign up for an account, login, and see a list of available hotels from all over the world. Users can create trips and add hotels to the trip for even more sight-seeing. The user can see all of their trips and their respective places inside the trips. 
Technologies include Ruby on Rails backend, PostgreSQL database, React.js frontend (also list any libraries, APIs, etc.)

Optional: Add screenshots or gifs of your application
